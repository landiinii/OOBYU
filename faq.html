                No, the app does not collect any private information or transmit your geographical location. It only uses Bluetooth to identify other phones running the app that are within ~10 feet. The app will ask to enable GPS; however, the location data DOES NOT leave the device. It is only used to facilitate running in the background.

                We will host the first simulation for 9 days starting on Friday, Feb 19th and lasting until Monday, Mar 1st.

                Sadly, no. Although there is no limit to the number of participants we can support, we  will close registration at 11:59m Thursday, Feb 18th. This is to give us enough time to finalize the number of QR codes we need to prepare.

              <li><p>
                In-person classes are actually what gives us the most useful contact information. We ask that you do not change your social behaviors and that you attend classes like normal.

            <ul>
              <li><p>
                No. We are only providing virtual vaccines that change the likelihood that your phone will be "infected" by the virus.

              <li><p>
                We are NOT infecting anyone with any infectious disease during this simulation. We are only using a virtual "virus" that "spreads" between phones that are running the app.

              <li><p>
                No. The primary goal of this simulation is to educate participants and provide an experiential learning experience.

            <ul>
              <li><p>
                Operation Outbreak simulations generate data that can be used in various contexts. Examples include: tracking vaccine protection among participants, the ability of pathogens to spread among social networks, and predicting how effective PPE can be. These data will be used to improve our understanding of how the BYU community responds to vaccines in order to better estimate requirements to achieve herd immunity.
