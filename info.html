            BYU Operation Outbreak (OO), a student association in connection with Operation Outbreak, was founded by Curtis Hoffmann with the goal of educating students about infectious diseases through experiential learning. OO BYU enables BYU undergraduate students to facilitate outbreak simulations at BYU and in K-12 schools while generating epidemiological models to improve understanding of outbreak culture among participants. OO BYU provides opportunities for students in science, technology, engineering, and math to apply their learning while at the same time creating opportunities for participant education.

                <u>Brett Pickett</u> - Assistant Professor in MMBio. Dr. Pickett finished schooling and worked in the biotech, industry, and academic fields prior to coming to BYU in 2019. Dr. Pickett's research lab mines data using the BYU supercomputer to learn how human cells react to disease--whether by infection or by other means. His group then uses this information to repurpose existing therapeutic drugs to reduce the effects of infectious diseases. Dr. Pickett lives in Pleasant Grove with his wife and 6 kids (4 girls and 2 boys).

                <u>Curtis Hoffmann</u> - Microbiology major from Orem, UT. Curtis is planning to pursue a PhD in Virology and subsequent MPH. Curtis aims to understand outbreak culture and build bridges between public health systems so that societies are better equipped to handle (or prevent) the next pandemic. Curtis started OO BYU to enhance public health education in Utah.

                <u>Craig Decker</u> - Molecular biology major from Seattle, WA. Craig wants to go to medical school to work on the clinical implementation of cell therapies and genetic treatments. Craig joined OO BYU because he liked the idea of involving a whole community to participate in research and experimental learning.

                <u>Madison Gray</u> - Biochemistry major from Lehi, Utah. Madi wants to receive her PhD. in immunology to create recovery and preventative treatment plans for tropical diseases. Madi joined OO BYU to help study and gain experience with virus outbreaks and spreading patterns to apply to further research.

                <u>Thomas Armond</u> - Physiology and Developmental Biology major from Provo, UT. Thomas wants to pursue a career in health care. Thomas joined OO BYU to help students - young and old - learn more about the mechanisms of outbreak response and the impact they have on the world.
